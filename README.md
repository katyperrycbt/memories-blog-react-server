# MEMORIES BLOG using NodeJS
This is the back-end side of the full-stack (MERN) application called 'Memories Blog'. 

## Tools
* M, E, N in the term 'MERN' stand for MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS - The three powerful tools to build the back-end side - Which is full of JavaScript.
* Why them? Simply because they are convenient, easy to read, easy to understand and do not need to learn new languages, are highly compatible and are the current trend and for many years to come.

## Functionalities
* Also, a CRUD back-end side application, where we call it a Server part. 
* The back-end and the front-end communicate with each other, just as with 3rd party software through the so-called API, they can work in different ways, as long as they communicate the same language (API).
* Functionalities: manages, processes and protects information - handle requests from the Clients.
